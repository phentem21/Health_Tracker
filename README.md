## Key Features

- **User Registration & Profile Management**  
  Secure registration and login allow users to manage profiles and view health records with ease.

- **Health Record Management**  
  Patients and healthcare providers can access and update health records, helping track health history and review previous conditions and treatments.

- **Appointment Scheduling**  
  An intuitive appointment scheduling system allows users to book and manage health appointments seamlessly.

- **Automated Reminders**  
  Integrated reminders and notifications using `node-cron` and `Nodemailer` for follow-up appointments and other health-related reminders, helping patients stay on top of their health schedules.

- **Secure Data Storage**  
  User health data is securely stored in MongoDB, using `Mongoose` for efficient and reliable database management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React for building responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js to manage server-side operations.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for secure and structured data handling.
- **Notifications**: `node-cron` for scheduling tasks and `Nodemailer` for sending email notifications.


## Usage and Installation 

- Download this zip file from github and open it in your code editor 
- In your Terminal RUN these commands to install all the dependencies

### Project Setup Guide

#### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed (version 14+ recommended).
2. **MongoDB**: Use MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or have a local MongoDB instance running.
3. **Heroku CLI** (optional): Only if deploying to Heroku.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

#### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd patient-health-tracker-backend
   ```
   
2. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install required backend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose dotenv cors axios
   ```

4. (Optional) Install additional libraries for deployment and notifications:
   - For email notifications:
     ```bash
     npm install nodemailer
     ```
   - For scheduling tasks:
     ```bash
     npm install node-cron
     ```

5. **Backend Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend root and set up necessary environment variables:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
     MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
     ```

#### Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies
1. Go to the frontend directory:
  - Open a new terminal 
     ```bash
      cd patient-health-tracker
     ```
   
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add essential frontend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   npm install react react-dom
   npm install @tabler/icons-react
   npm install framer-motion
   ```

#### Step 4: Install Python and Related Dependencies (for AI Model)
1. Ensure **Python 3** is installed (Python 3.8 or higher).
2. Set up a virtual environment for Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install required Python packages for machine learning:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
   ```

4. If youâ€™re using `python-shell` for running Python scripts from Node.js, install it in the backend:
   ```bash
   npm install python-shell
   ```

#### Step 5: Running the Project Locally
1. Start the **backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd patient-health-tracker-backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Open a new terminal for the **frontend** and run:
   ```bash
   cd patient-health-tracker
   npm run dev
   ```
